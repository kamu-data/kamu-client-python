- Set sane default connection timeouts
- Limit maxrows / add sampling by default (+ warning)
- Ability to query at specific block
- Search API
- Push data API
- CI actions
- Async interface

- Consider connecting to ODF HTTP and discovering engine URLs instead of connecting directly
- Consider not allowing fully non-authenticated access and making anonymous users go through basic auth procedure so that server had a clear point to reject new client or apply backpressure. Upon auth the server would assign a temporary session token that can be used to identify the client and apply rate limiting strategies.
